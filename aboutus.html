        <h2>Meme SMP Saga</h2>
        <p>My name is Amethyst and I started Nexon in May of 2023, but it wasn't always Nexon. It was known as Meme SMP in the spring of 2021. A small server I hosted with Aternos for me and my friends. It was very, very popular for quite a long time. Going from April of 2021 to June of 2021. In June the player numbers started to die out. I chose to make a new server or season of Meme SMP. I spent July and into the begining of August of 2021 working on Meme SMP Season One. However it ended up being a disater, It took to long to make, It was buggy, It wasn't what people expected from me and there were just about no players. After that I took a long break from running Meme SMP or Minecraft Servers entirely.</p>
        <p>In November of 2022 I started the second official season of Meme SMP. Which was relitivly popular with a fairly consistant player count and interest in the server. This was great after the disaster that was Meme SMP Season One. After Season Two died off. I made Season Three which is the shortest season of any server I have ran. It last around six days before it was shutdown. After this shut down it's time for Nexon to shine.</p>
        <h2>Nexon Saga</h2>
        <p>A few months after the shutdown of Season Three I started work on Meme SMP Season Four or what I though was going to be Meme SMP Seaon Four. When working on Meme SMP Season Four I realized I wanted to take a diffrent approtch to the way I ran and managed Minecraft Servers, Knowing this I made the somewhat iffy decition to rename Meme SMP to Nexon and remove all previous assotiation from the server and try again on a clean slate. I started the First Episode of Nexon on May 15th, 2023. It was hard to get people to play at first. People weren't interested in playing another one of my servers either because they didn't want to play Minecraft or they felt like I was just going to die like all the other servers I had ran upto this point. After a lot of convincing I started to get people to play on Nexon Episode One and luckly they loved it. After that I ran Episode Two and it was even more popular than the first one. Unfornetly after that the magic died and the server has been struggling to get players on the current server.</p>
        <h2>The final chapter</h2>
        <p>In the End people love Meme SMP and Nexon and I am happy to run a server that people love and play. I hope that with the server becoming public sometime in 2024-26 it will become bigger and better with a community of kind supportive players. Thank you all for reading the history of Nexon and Meme SMP. Be sure to read the Archives for more information about Nexon and Meme SMP more specificly season by season.</p>
