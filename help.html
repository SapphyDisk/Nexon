        <h1>Frequently asked questions!</h1> <h1>The help resources will be added at a later date. For now it's just gonna be frequently asked questions. Since I am not currently sure what help I need with and how to go about it. Thanks!</h1>
        <h1>Question: Does Nexon have microtransactions?</h1>
        <h1>Answer: No. Nexon does not have microtransactions. Nexon does have a donation page to help the server become a better place for everyone.</h1>
        <h1>Follow up question: Will Nexon ever have microtransactions?</h1>
        <h1>Answer: Most likely not. I hate microtransactions and really do not want to add them to the server. I feel like for a game you already pay for it's just a kick in the balls to have to pay even more money on worthless cosmetics.</h1>
        <h1>Second follow up question: Will it ever be required to donate to the server?</h1>
        <h1>Answer: I will never fully require a player to donate money to play on Nexon. It's meant to be a free safe place for people to play and releax, but I will highly encurage a donation if you want things like better hardware or a proper domain. I can't personally afford all of these things out of pocket so any and all donations are very, very useful and I am greatful for anyone who donates.</h1>
        <h1>Question: Does or will Nexon have ranks?</h1>
        <h1>Answer: Yes, Kind of. What I mean is Nexon does have "ranks" but they're only for the people helping me with the server. For normal players there is no ranks.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>If you guys have anymore questions make sure to submit them in the Nexon discord server and I will be sure to add them here!</h1>
